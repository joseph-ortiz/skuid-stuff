# skuid-stuff
Chrome extension for Skuid model data

##About
I built this tool because I constantly need to query model data during development.
Note: this does NOT  work in Service Console.

##Installation
1. clone this repo
2. In Chrome, type the following in the omnibox.
```bash
chrome://extensions
```
3. Open up a skuid page
4. In the elements panel, there should be a new tab on the right sidebar.
